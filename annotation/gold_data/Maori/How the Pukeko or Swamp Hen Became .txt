How the Pukeko or Swamp Hen Became Red-headed
In days of old when gods and men foregathered, and marvels were as the sands of the sea shore, the pukeko came into the world as a bird of sedate appearance. The origin of this bird is traced to Punga, and, when first seen by Tawhaki, had only recently been born. Now Tawhaki was engaged in building a house named Rangiura and by a mischance cut himself with his adze named the Rakuraku-a-Tawhaki. Said Tawhaki to Punga: "Leave your child with me as a foster child"â€”and to this Punga consented. Then Tawhaki smeared blood from his wounded hand on the forehead of Pakura the pukeko as a token of his adoption of one of the offspring of Punga. Now, like most other Maori tales there is another version in connection with this story, and it is to the effect that, when Tawhaki was ascending the heavens, he met Pakura and Matuku (swamp-hen and bittern) descending to this world, and the forehead of Pakura was bleeding. It was explained that Pakura had been eating the shell-fish of Tamaiwaho, hence the latter struck Pakura and ripped the skin from his forehead. Observe the red mark of that wound as still seen on the head of Pakura, also the bill stained red with flowing blood in days when man was young.

The owl and bat (ruru and pekapeka) were personified in Popoia and Peka, and these two birds are said to have originally been denizens of the underworld of Rarohenga, and this is why these birds do not move abroad during the daytime, but only during the hours of darkness.
