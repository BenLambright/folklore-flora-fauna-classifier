Fable of the Aute or Paper Mulberry and the Whau
Said the Whau to the Aute:â€”"Hei kona koe tu ai hex pare wahine." (Stay you there to serve as fillets for women). Said the Aute to the Whau: "Haere koe ki te moana heipouto kupenga" (Go you to the ocean to serve as net floats).

Now, we see that those things are used for the very purposes mentioned, net floats are fashioned from that wood, and the inner bark of aute is used as fillets.
