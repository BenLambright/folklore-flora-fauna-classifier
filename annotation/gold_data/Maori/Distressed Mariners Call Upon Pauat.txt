Distressed Mariners Call Upon Pauatere to Succour Them
When the vessel Takitimu was on her way hither from the isles of Polynesia some five centuries ago the crew was in distress owing to lack of food. One Ngutoro cried: "Alas! Misfortune assails us." Te Ariki-whakaroau enquired: "What distresses you?" Replied Ngutoro: "The lack of food; hunger weakens the arm of man." Again Te Ariki spoke: "Call to Pauatere in the ocean depths"—and Ngutoro called: "O Pauatere! Are you below?" Pauatere replied from the deep: "Here am I"—and so Ngutoro bade him ascend; then was seen the multitudes of Pauatere ascending from ocean depths, myriads of paua shellfish that clung to the sides of the vessel and so provided sustenance for the distressed seafarers. In later days hunger again assailed the crew of Takitimu and then it was that Hine-kuku was called upon to rise from the depths of Hine-moana, and so came thousands of kuku, mussels, that provided food for the ocean wanderers. Thus we see that even shellfish were subservient to man in the long past centuries, that is to man versed in dealing with occult matters.
