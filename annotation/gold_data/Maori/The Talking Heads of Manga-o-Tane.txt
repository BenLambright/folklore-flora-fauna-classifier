The Talking Heads of Manga-o-Tane
We have already seen that carved wooden images, or at least some of them, were in olden times gifted with powers of speech, as also were trees, mountains, and divers other things. In the following story we find that decapitated heads speak, or did upon one occasion. Apparently this was not a common occurrence, inasmuch as the exhibition of such a faculty caused terror among the hearers. The occasion was a fight that occurred at Manga-o-Tane, far up the Whakatane river some ten generations ago. Ngati-Manawa of Whirinaki killed Tutonga and Tamakere of Tuhoe, cut off their heads and carried them off as trophies. Tuhoean avengers pursued the party of raiders and overtook it at Marumaru. As these pursuers drew near the raiders the member of the latter party who was carrying the two heads heard them speaking; one said: "How soon?", while the other replied, saying: "Very soon." The head-bearer was much alarmed at hearing the heads talking and so was told by a leader to cast them away. No sooner had he done so than the avengers came up and attacked the party, killing eight of them, but we hear no more of the talking heads.
