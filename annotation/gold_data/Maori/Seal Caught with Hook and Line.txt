Seal Caught with Hook and Line
In olden times a certain blind man went a fishing on the sea beach, and, when casting his line, he so turned round as to cast his line inland instead of seaward. He then waited for a bite, which, after some time, he got, for his own dog came along, saw and swallowed the bait, and so was caught on the hook. The blind fisherman hauled in his line and found that he had caught what he took to be a seal, which seal he promptly killed. He then prepared a steam oven into which he put the body of his catch and then covered the oven. Sometime later his wife arrived and opened the oven, in which she found the cooked body of their dog. It happened to be a favourite dog with the old folks, and it was long ere the blind fisherman heard the last of his famous seal.
