The Woman who Ate her Child's Heart
There was once a woman who was very fond of pigeons' hearts, and was ever compelling her husband to go to the forest to take pigeons, that she might obtain her favourite food, so that, in PAGE 582time, those birds became scarce. One day, the husband returned without having secured a single bird, and his wife scolded him bitterly for being so lazy. Next day, he again went forth into the forest in search of birds, and took with him their only child, a little boy. He took the child a long way into the forest, where he killed him, but he took out the child's heart and carried it home. But before going home, he invoked the power of the gods to cause the forest trees to acquire the power of speech, and to answer anyone calling out as they searched for the child.

On arriving at his home, the child's heart was cooked for his wife, who remarked on its size, but said that it was the best she had ever eaten. She enquired for the child but was told that he had strayed away from his father, and was lost. Then she entered the forest to search for him, and, as she advanced, called the child's name. A tree at some distance answered her; she proceeded in that direction and called again, whereupon a tree further off answered. So it went on; each time she called out, another tree answered her, until she became lost in the forest, and was never seen again, but yet ever wanders in the forest, calling for her child, and following the demon voice. And sometimes the voice of the demon may be heard proceeding from enchanted trees; answering the call of the woman who ate the heart of her only child.
