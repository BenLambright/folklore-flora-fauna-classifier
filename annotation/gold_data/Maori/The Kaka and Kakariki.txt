The Kaka and Kakariki
A simple little folk tale of old tells how the kaka parrot filched from the parroquet its bright red plumage and concealed the same under his wings; the following is a rendering of a brief recital:

"Here is the song of parroquet, calling upon the parrot to return its fine plumageâ€”

"O Kaka, flying yonder, give me my brilliant plumage, I procured my gay feathers at the sacred isle of Tinirau. Torete! Kaureke! Torete! Kaureke!"

The kaka bird has a curved upper bill, and bright red feathers on the inner sides of its wings. The kakariki has a similar bill to that of the parrot, but its feathers differ. When the parrot saw that the feathers of the parroquet caused great admiration, it began to jeer at it, and caused it to become confused; then the red feathers of 8 the parroquet were plucked out and appropriated by the parrot, who gave its own feathers to the parroquet. Having so obtained his feathers the parrot fled with them. When the parroquet beheld the parrot flying about glorifying in his plumage, then it lamented aloud, hence its song already given. The parroquet had obtained its plumage at the home of Tinirau, the name of which place was Motu-tapu" (A longer version of the above song of the kakariki appears in Sir George Grey's Nga Moteatea, p. 74).

The following recital is said to have been repeated by a warrior when he was dressing and decorating his hair prior to entering a fight "Te kakariki nei homai aku kura. Ehara, waiho ano aku kura hei kura kaia maku ki tawhiti, torete kai."
