How the Totara Came to Pop When Burned
Once upon a time the trees of the forest met together in order to discuss certain matters, and so the tribes of totara, matai, rimu, maire, toromiro, and others assembled. They argued as to whose PAGE 592feet would reach the heavens should they stand with head downward. The totara claimed that it would certainly reach their ancestor Rangi in that way, but the rimu said that it would do so, then maire, rata, tawa and pohue all maintained that they would win the contest, each tree tribe claimed to be the one that would reach the sky. So the contest began, and the totara was the first to try and stretch itself to the sky above, but totara met with a mishap that excited ridicule, hence there was riotous applause. And so, in these days, when you use totara as fuel you will not fail to hear the popping sound that brought shame to the tribe in days of long ago; and that also was why the totara abandoned conspicuous places whereat to dwell, and betook itself to the depths of the forest there to abide far away from the open world. There were others who met with similar mishaps, and when the winds of Tawhirimatea are abroad you may hear the tree branches creaking; they seem to say—"Whe! Whe!, " but they are really saying—"Iou hemo! Iou hemo!"
