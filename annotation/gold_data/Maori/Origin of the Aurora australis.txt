Origin of the Aurora australis
Another quaint tale, one recited by a Maori of Whanganui in 1869 explains with charming clearness the origin of the Aurora australis. It appears that, some five or more centuries ago, a number of vessels came southward from the isles of the Pacific. Some of these migrants remained here and settled in the new land, but others pushed on and sailed southward in seach of other lands, or simply to observe the wonders of the deep. Some of these vessels returned hither to Aotearoa, but others never did so, their crews settling in the remote lands of the far south. The belief is that the descendants of those old seafarers of past centuries are still dwelling in those lands, and have no means of coming northward to more genial climes, hence, ever and anon, they kindle huge fires in order to let the Maori folk of Aotearoa know that they are still there, and also in need of assistance. When the light from those appealing fires is seen gleaming in the heavens the Maori knows that the descendants of the castaways are signalling from the drear realm of Paraweranui, but there is no record of any rescue party having sailed southward to help them.
