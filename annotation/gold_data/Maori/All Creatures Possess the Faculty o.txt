All Creatures Possess the Faculty of Speech
According to an aid octogenarian friend of mine all creatures obtained the power of speech in remote times, that is to say when all creatures were begotten. "Rangi and Papa and their offspring begat all things, and all living creatures then became possessed of bodies, heads and limbs; the big things originated as big things, and the small things as small ones. To each creature the power of PAGE 589speech, a certain kind of speech, was given. At the same time they speak in different tongues, even that one species cannot understand the speech of another. Now the speech of our ancestors was clear and readily understood, also it has remained so. Yet although birds, reptiles, insects, fish, the denizens of land and water, possess this power of speech, yet we human folk cannot understand it. What meaning has such speech? Who can tell; only when sleep comes to us can we understand it. When we go to the Reinga in sleep, then a dog or bird speaks to us as men speak, in our own speech; this shows us that human speech is superior to that of dogs and birds."
