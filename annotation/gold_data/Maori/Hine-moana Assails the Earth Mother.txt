Hine-moana Assails the Earth Mother
The great power possessed by water is well known to all men, be they civilised or savage, and the Maori assigns ceaseless energy and destructive power to Hine-moana the Ocean Maid, she who ever attacks her own forebear, the Earth Mother. Ever the surging ranks of Ngaru-nui and Ngaru-roa roll in to attack the flanks of Papa the Parentless, ever the relentless battalions of Hine-moana gnaw their way into her great body, but ever PAGE 586Rakahore, Hine-one and Hine-tuakiri-kiri stand faithfully on guard to defend the mother of all things. Thus it is that we see the raging waters hurl themselves in vain on the sturdy rocks, the soft, yielding, but indomitable sand, the rattling gravel beds that move and complain, but never give way. Thus spoke a folk lore expert of the brown folk: "The gravel and stones and their younger relatives preserve the bounds of the ocean and of the land, hence the bounds of Hine-moana budge not; it was Parawhenuamea who so arranged matters."
