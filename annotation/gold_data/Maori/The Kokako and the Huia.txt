The Kokako and the Huia
In days of yore the kokako or crow had extremely handsome plumage, but the huia filched the fine plumage and left his own dingy garb for the crow. Another story is to the effect that the crow resolved to equal the huia in appearance; as the crow sat on his tree looking at the huia, he remarked: "Ah! How fine is the appearance of the huia, all birds admire its appearance; I much desire to resemble the huia." Now he chanced to espy a dead huia lying by the wayside, and so he borrowed the form of the bill PAGE 566of that huia and expected to be greatly admired, but he found himself laughed at by all birds, who jeered at him and said: "Ha! Look at the crow trying to ape the appearance of the huia, though he still bears his crow-like aspect as of old."
