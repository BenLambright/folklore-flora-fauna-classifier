The Woman Who was Taken to the Sky by Spiders
In the days of old there lived a woman whose husband was extremely unkind to her, hence she appealed to the gods to deliver her from this affliction. The appeal was heard, and Ruruhi-kerepo came to her, and enquired into her trouble. The woman said that she wished to escape from the cruelty of her husband. So Ruruhi-kerepo called two spiders, who came from the clouds, and made a web basket big enough to hold the woman and her child. Then Ruruhi-kerepo put the two into the basket, and told the spiders to convey the basket to the heavens.

The deserted husband lived a lone life until old age, and, when he died, he went to the spirit world. There he saw a number of people assembled together, and asked them the object of such a gathering. They told him that a young man was about to have the Tohi, or ceremony of baptism, performed over him, and to PAGE 581receive his second, or adult's name, his first or child's name having been given him when he was a baby, that being the first Tohi rite. Now this young man was the child taken by the spiders to the heavens, the man's own son. Pretty soon he met his wife, who did not know him, because he was now old and grey haired, but in relating the story of his life in this world, he made himself known. Then they lived together again, for there is no quarrelling in the spirit world. Here comes another tale of the Ruruhi-kerepoâ€”
