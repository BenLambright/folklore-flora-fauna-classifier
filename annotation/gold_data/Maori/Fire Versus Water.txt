Fire Versus Water
The old, old myth of the contest between water and fire has been preserved by our Maori folk, and a version of it is given at p. 155 of vol. 3 of the Journal of the Polynesian Society. The remnants of fire that survived the attacks of water took refuge in trees and rock. At the same time this fire, called the fire of Mahuika, is really of less importance than the Ahi o Tapeka or Fire of Tapeka, which is the fire that burns in the underworld.
