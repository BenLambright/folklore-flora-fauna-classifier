Story of the Ruruhi-kerepo
Some of the folk lore tales of the Maori are as puerile as some of our own, which is saying a good deal. Such is the fable of the Ruruhi-kerepo (blind old woman), which runs as follows: "A very long time ago, five girls went a roaming in the forest, where they met an old woman. One said: "Oh, here is an old dame [ruruhi]." But the latter said—"You must not call me ruruhi, but kuia [old woman]." A girl remarked—"Oh, she is a kuia." Again the old dame objected—"You must not call me kuia, but matua keke [aunt], "—whereupon a girl cried—"I greet you, aunt." Then the old woman caught hold of the girl who had just spoken, and said—"Embrace me." She caught all five of the girls, and made them climb up into the trees of the forest, and said—"O my nieces, how sweet you look up there; I could eat you all, I could eat each one of you at a mouthful." She then shook the trees, crying—"Drop off! Drop off!—and, as each girl fell from the trees, she bit off the girl's head, and ate the body.

"When, at length, their friends came in search of the missing girls, they found only their heads, and, nearby, they saw the Ruruhi-kerepo. One man strove to kill her with his spear, but she struck and killed him with a blow of her fist. But while she was biting his head off, his friends all attacked her and speared her to death. They could not strike her with their clubs, because the bones of those she had eaten stuck out of her body like the spines of the kopu-totara [porcupine fish]; hence they speared her. They then cooked and ate her."
