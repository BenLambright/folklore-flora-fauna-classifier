The Lost Child of Takaraho
Of these simple folk tales a number have been collected, and many more have doubtless passed into oblivion. The story of the lost child of Takaraho that follows is but one of many of that class. The child of a woman named Takaraho wandered alone into the forest one day, and was seized and carried off by some uncanny dweller in the wilderness. The parents went in search of the child, and heard it crying in the forest, but could not find it. Other persons joined in the search, and heard the voice of the child, but never found it, for when they seemed to approach near it, then the voice would be heard in quite a different quarter. Hence they at length concluded that the child had become a forest elve, a super-natural being, through the influence of the beings who had carried it off, and so the search was abandoned. Even so, when strange, unaccountable sounds are heard in the forest then some person will say: "O, it is the Child of Takaraho crying." In a version of this tale given in Te Ika a Maui (2nd ed., p. 285) it is stated that the kidnapper of the child was known as PAGE 583the tahae o te koraha or tahae of the wilderness. Employed in this way the word tahae means much the same as nanakia, a title already referred to.
