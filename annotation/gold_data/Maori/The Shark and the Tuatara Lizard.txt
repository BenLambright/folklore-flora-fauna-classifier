The Shark and the Tuatara Lizard
When the waters in the heavens became too warm then Mango (shark), Para (frost-fish), Piharau (lamprey), Tuna (eel) and others came down to earth in search of cooler waters. It was then that Mango the shark said to Tuatara, the great lizard: "Come now, let us go and dwell in the ocean"—but Tuatara replied: "No, rather let us reside on land." So they argued for some time but could not agree as to where they should live; meanwhile Tuna had concealed himself in a swamp, Tuere (blind eel) had beslimed himself in the ocean, Piharau had crept under boulders for safety, while Inanga (whitebait) had sought refuge in shoal waters where Para and Mango could not follow him. At length Mango said to Tuatara: "Very well, remain on land to be loathed by all"—but Tuatara replied: "It is well, for that will give me distinction, and I will thrive. As for you, you will be hauled up with a hook in your mouth, cast into a canoe, and have your head pounded with a fernroot-pounding mallet, after which you will be PAGE 569hung up to dry like a wet rag." Here these two malcontents parted, but assuredly in both cases their prophecies came true. In another version of the above fable Tuatara tells Mango the shark to go to his ocean home that he may be caught and served up with cooked vegetables as food for man. The shark retorted by telling Tuatara to remain on land and so be destroyed by fire when the dry bracken was burned off.
