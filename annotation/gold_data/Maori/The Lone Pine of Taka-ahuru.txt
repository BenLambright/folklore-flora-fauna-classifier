The Lone Pine of Taka-ahuru
All kinds of quaint tales are heard concerning things impossible in the byways of Maoriland, of persons turned into stone, of amazing deeds performed by mythical beings of hoar antiquity. PAGE 594Thus we are told that the white pine bush that formerly existed at Makauri inland of Turangi-nui-a-Ruamatua sprang from a single branch of the Kahika or white pine tree that grows in the sea at Tokahuru, off the Gisborne coast. When the famed vessel Takitimu arrived from Polynesia and came down the eastern coast, she called at Te Mawhai and then came on to somewhere off the Tapuwae o Rongokako, where Hautu proposed that they stay awhile and endeavour to catch some fish. This must have been in shoal water, inasmuch as the fishers appear to have used one of the sprits of the vessel to tie the bow rope to. The spot where this occurred was named Toka-ahuru; one version states that it was so named after the sprit, though the name of the sprit is given as Toko-ahuru. This spar seems to have developed into a kahika tree that grows, blooms and flourishes in the salt waves of Toka-ahuru, and is viewed as a tipua.
