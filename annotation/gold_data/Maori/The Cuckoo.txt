The Cuckoo
As for the cuckoo, it is, of course, a well known fact that Mahuru (personified form of spring), sends the cuckoo to these islands every spring in order to tell the Maori folk that the koanga or crop planting season has arrived. Even so the cuckoo, the far travelled one, is heard calling out—"Koia! Koia! Koia!"…, thus urging man to dig and plant. The song of this cuckoo is given as: "Inu koe ki whea?Inu aw ki waipuna; rokohanga atu e au te tupu o te kumara e waihora ana. Tioro! Tioro! (Where did you drink? I drank at water springs; I found the shoots of the sweet potato in vigorous growth.) The Maori folk in some parts affect to believe that the cuckoo passes the winter underground by burying itself in mud in autumn; others maintain that it springs from a certain species of lizard. At Pihanga is a certain lake or pond wherein is a bird called manapou that has a peculiar double crest; this bird is said to give birth to its young in the bed of the lake. Wanderers and shiftless folk are said to be allied to the cuckoo. Maori children were wont to greet the first cuckoo to appear with the following address—"E manu! Tena koe! Kua tae tenei ki te mahanatanga, kua puawai nga rakau katoa, kua pa te kakara ki te ihu o te tangata. Kua puta ano koe ki runga tioro ai, tioro i te whitu, tioro i te waru; me tioro haere ano e koe tenei kupu e whai ake nei ki te marae o tama ma, o hine ma—Kui! kui! kui! whitiwhiti ora" ("O bird! I greet you! The warm season has now arrived and all trees are in bloom, the fragrance reaching the nostrils of man. You now appear again on high trilling as of yore, PAGE 565trilling in the seventh, trilling in the eighth; fare on your way singing this message that follows o'er the plaza of lads and lasses. Kui! Kui! Kui! Whitiwhiti ora!"
