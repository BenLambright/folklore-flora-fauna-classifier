War Between the Mussel and Cockle Tribes
We have seen that, in Maori myth, Te Arawaru and Kaumaihi had offspring twelve who were the various species of pipi or cockles. As time wore on a feud arose between the Kuku and Pipi clans, that is the Mussel and Cockle tribes at Waikaru, and, after this strife had continued for some time, the Pipi folk continued it at Onetahua, where they found shelter behind their earthworks, that is they buried themselves in sandy beaches. The Kuku folk advanced to attack them, but when they thrust out their tongues they became filled with sand, and so the offspring of Kaukau, the Mussel folk, were defeated by those of Te Arawaru. Now this is why we see the Pipi folk still dwelling with their ancestress Hineone, the Sand Maid, while their elder brethren, the Kuku, abide without, where they ever cling to Rakahore (rocks). When Takaaho and Te Puwhakahara heard of this strife they said: PAGE 575"What are these little folk quarrelling about?" The latter said to Takaaho: "O friend! Our young folk are suffering through lack of food, go, procure the offspring of Te Arawaru to serve as food for our children." Takaaho replied: "They will retire behind their breastworks and so be inaccessible, "â€”to which Te Pu remarked: "Induce them to come outside their defences and then scoop them up." Then the assailing party of Takaaho rose and went to Onetahua, whereupon the offspring of Te Arawaru retired within their fortified places. Takaaho attacked Pipi-toretore and the others and his attacking party was defeated, the gills of Takaaho becoming filled with sand, as those of whales are when they drift ashore. This contest is known as Waimapihi.

In the above fable mussels attack cockles, who retire into the sand and so baffle their assailants, who are not at home in sandy areas. Later, when sharks assailed the Pipi folk they also were defeated by Hineone, that is to say by sand.
