Fight between Lizards and Dogs
After the escape of the tail of Kaiwhaka-ruaki, the great lizard-like taniwha of olden times, lizards became very numerous in the land, so much so that they quarrelled with other creatures. Thus a lizard one day met a dog on a forest path and the two fell out regarding right of passage; each returned and told its friends that the other had insulted him sorely. So all the dogs assembled to discuss the matter, and dogs were very numerous in those remote times; they roamed in packs over the plains, and had not yet been tamed by man. Then all the lizards of the different lizard tribes collected together, and the two parties decided to fight the matter out. In the battle that ensued, the dogs were victorious, and, having beaten their enemies, they ate the slain lizards. It was this eating of the lizards that affected the fertility of the dog, and is the reason why they never became very numerous.
