The Deceiving of Kapoho
He taiari a Kapoho i raru ai.
He hei taiari a Kapoho i raru ai.

These sayings are from the story of the deceiving of Kapoho, a Taranaki woman, by Te Ao~piki, of Waikato. When on a visit to Taranaki, Te Ao told Kapoho that the taiari shell grew on trees at Waikato and were picked in quantities every year to form the hei PAGE 574taiari (shell necklace), an ornament much desired by maidens. Hence the girl married Te Ao and went home with him to Waikato, where she searched in vain for the tree that produced taiari shells.
