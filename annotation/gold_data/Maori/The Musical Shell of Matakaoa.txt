The Musical Shell of Matakaoa
In times of old, long before the white-skinned tipua came across the ocean from far lands beyond the red sun path, the Maori folk of Matakaoa, when fishing off the coast, were wont to hear strange songs within the waters where their canoes floated, songs sung by some invisible creature in darkling depths. Upon a time the men in one canoe lowered their stone anchor at the spot, and, when the anchor was hauled up, a pupu tara (Septa tritonis) was found clinging to it; this was the origin of the songs heard by fishermen in the vicinity prior to that time. This shell was fitted with a mouthpiece and used as a shell trumpet for many years, and that trumpet was ever viewed as something uncanny, in fact as a tipua, and it was named Hinemokemoke.
