Sun v. Moon Contention
It is of course a well known fact that the sun and moon once fell out over the question of night or day movement. The sun maintained that both should move across the breast of Rangi the Sky Parent during the daytime, but the moon stoutly maintained that night was the proper time for them to be abroad. On this subject they quite failed to agree, and so, after some altercation, they grew quite testy, and the moon said to the sun: "Very well, go on your way, you will be useful for drying clothes." To this incisive remark the sun replied: "Move you by night and so tremble before the food ovens." And we see that the sun has the real control, the moon's movements are confined to night, while the sun leads the way. Such was the contention of those persons. In another old tale winter and summer are represented by Pipiri and Whakaahu, these two are ever contending with each other, but neither has ever won a permanent victory.
